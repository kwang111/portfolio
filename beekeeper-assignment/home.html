                        <br>
                        <p>
                            During shopping period for classes in early January 2020, right before the pandemic hit, I
                            was
                            able
                            to meet a wonderful person who loves to draw. She creates wonderful character designs and
                            crafts
                            an
                            awe-inspiring world and story for her characters. I found out that she stores some of her
                            characters
                            on a site called Toy House (as displayed below in part 1).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Though the existing website does a decent job to let viewers look at my friend’s characters,
                            I
                            was
                            wondering if there is a better way to convey the magical world she is building through a
                            re-design
                            of the website. Thus (with my still-in-the-learning HTML/CSS skills) I tried to design a
                            website
                            that would feel more personal and unique.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I sincerely thank my friend LargeOnion for letting me borrow her beautiful art to set up
                            this
                            re-designed website project. She loves bees so I tried to go with a honey/sweet aesthetic
                            for
                            the
                            portfolio presentation as well.

                        <p style="text-indent: 0">
                            ・3 column-ish grouping which does a loose job of gathering elements
                            <br>
                            ・Lack of hierarchy: important information (like navigation tools and author bio) have small
                            text while
                            the comment section takes up way too much space
                            <br>
                            ・Even the buttons are just all layed out instead of catagorized, making it have a more
                            database-ish. I
                            want to make the page more ‘cozy’ and feel more creative.
                            <br>
                            ・Generally, very database-like with a lot of duplicate categories casual users can’t tell
                            the difference
                            between.
                        </p>
                        <h6 style="text-indent: 0">Learnability:</h6>
                        <p style="text-indent: 0">
                            ・Feels like a standard database layout (reminds me of canvas) so may be easy to learn for
                            people who are
                            used to these sorts of “online data storage platforms”

                            <br>
                            ・Character pages are similar to author page but slightly different (which kind of threw me
                            off and I got
                            lost navigating between pages)

                            <br>
                            ・Profile-pages have 2 kinds: users and creations. The creation is treated as a ‘user’ making
                            it
                            difficult to distinguish between what is the creator and what is the creation.
                            <br>
                            ・Some small elements/buttons are difficult to see (and I did not discover them until later
                            uses)
                            <br>
                            [For example: small buttons below characters on creator’s “recent characters & designs”
                            section]
                        </p>

                        <p style="text-indent: 0">
                            ・A bit difficult to navigate through pages: often forget which buttons are clickable and
                            which are not.
                            <br>
                            ・Some categories are duplicate and I forget the differences between them (characters/designs
                            all seem to
                            have the same information but subtly different)
                            <br>
                            ・Author home page “recent characters & designs” are similar but different than the character
                            page
                            (character page has folders sorting characters by story/worls)
                        </p>
                        <h6 style="text-indent: 0">Efficiency:</h6>
                        <p style="text-indent: 0">
                            ・Difficult to navigate back and forth between pages: Author profile page, character page,
                            story page
                            etc. links are hard to grasp and easy to get lost jumping between pages
                            <br>
                            ・Want to be able to jump between character pages but have to go through Author page or story
                            page
                            <br>
                            ・Inviting dead-end: “User” text is bolded and seems clickable but actually isn’t
                            <br>
                            ・Many buttons leading to tools/locations that author does not necessarily need/use
                            (bulliten, library)

                            <br>
                            ・Categories may be useful for other users but for my friend who focuses on storing images as
                            info, the
                            library section may not be useful (hiding it will help viewers navigate)

                            <br>
                            ・Some buttons lead to pop-up windows that take up too much space, making it difficult to
                            exit and focus
                            on the relevant information
                            <br>
                            [For example: clicking on ‘favorites’ of a character brings up a list of user with gigantic
                            profile
                            pictures and covers the character description (distracting)]
                        </p>
                        <div class="spacer"></div>
                        <h5>Accessibility Issues</h5>
                        <p>There seems to be a lack of font hierarchy so it is difficult to map pages to buttons and
                            descriptions to
                            sections. The page in general lack of consistency in the distinction between buttons and
                            text. Some
                            buttons are also very low-contrast. For example, the very-hard-to-read small star icon below
                            characters
                            are not clickable but the image icon next to it is. Most text is read-able (no image with a
                            lot of text)
                            but there is a lack of context/text hierarchy. There is also a lack of descriptive titles
                            for
                            navigation. This leads to the screen reader (voiceover) reading text without enough context
                            for the
                            reader to understand what they are listening to. Furthermore, images either do not have
                            accurate
                            descriptions (just numbers or random characters) or the images straight-up do not have
                            informative
                            alt-tags (alternate text) for voiceover or for times where the images fail to load. Lastly,
                            there are
                            empty links inviting dead-ends (most apparent in comment section) and redundant links which
                            all lead to
                            the same page.</p>

                            ・Most tools are clustered on the left (feels unbalanced)

                            ・Lack of efficiency when trying to update: have to go to the character page and then manage

                            ・I used flexboxes to display my items so I'm glad they wrapped well as the screen changed
                            size

                            <br>
                            ・I used media queries to change the social media icons so even on smaller screens they can
                            be easily clicked

                            <br>
                            ・In inspect elements, I changed font to 150% and 200% and I am glad the background/buttons
                            adjust to contain the text
                            <br>
                            ・I enjoyed looking at what LargeOnion is in different languages

                            ・WAVE found my empty links (because buttons/nav bar is not fully implemented)

                <h4>Conclusion and Takeaways</h4>
                <p>From this redesign project, I learned how to identify accessibility and usability issues hidden amongst interfaces. Furthermore, I learned how to make wireframes (lo-fi and hi-fi mockups) with programs such as Balsamiq and Adobe XD. I was also able to strengthen my HTML skills (coding the entire website from scratch). One important concept I learned was to use media queries to allow the website to be responsive.</p>
                <h4>
                    Takeaways:
                  </h4>
                  <ol>
                    <li>I should have use computer software to annotate mockups because right now they are a bit difficult to read.</li>
                    <li>I realized that when designing, hierarchy is very important. I should be braver in using different font sizes.</li>
                    <li>For re-design, I learned that having clear sections and clean interfaces will benefit the webpages readability. </li>
                    <li>I hand-coded everything for this website so some of the components are a bit clunky. I have learned how to use bootstrap after this assignment which helped me make better webpages (check out the Development project!) </li>
