                            Story:
                        </h4>
                        <p>
                            One day at lunch, my mother started giving a half-hour long speech
                            lecturing our family members on the importance of waste-sorting
                            after she discovered an orange peal in the recycling instead of
                            compost. My father responded by sighing in annoyance and my brother
                            eagerly defended himself as being a great community member who always
                            sorts his trash even though I have seen him throw compost in regular
                            trash multiple times. I, on the other hand, started wondering why
                            our family members respond differently to our kitchen trash system.
                            Therefore, I chose our kitchen trash system as the interface I am
                            observing and I interviewed my family with a focus on the compost
                            bin for this project.
                        </p>

                            I observed users interacting with the Kitchen Compost Bin
                            and created personas and storyboards. It is interesting to hear
                            about the motivations behind trash-sorting from different perspectives.

                            Inteface: Kitchen Compost Bin
                        </h4>
                        <p>
                            The interface I chose to observe is the kitchen compost bin.
                            This compost bin is used mainly by my family members. It seems like a generic bin, so there are probably a lot of other users with the same model.
                            Below is a diagram of the interface. The interface is composed of a lid, a box, a plastic bag, and compostable waste.
                            The box body contains a metal handle for users to lift the bin with. This makes it easier for users to carry the bin to larger comost bins (usually outdoors).
                            The main difficulty with this interface is the compost bin’s lid.
                            The compost requires a lid because the contents are often stinky
                            yet the lid’s design discourages users to open the container.
                        </p>

                        (Currently, They have to rest the lid on top of the other trash lid and then throw

                        and “allowing the trash to be more productive.” They represent a frequent user of the compost.

                        Their reason for their use of the compost is for the trash-truck
                        to accept the trash: if the trash is not catagorized, the
                        trash truck will not take it. They represent a user
